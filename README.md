Object detection and tracking process using a pre-trained model for detection. The focus of this project is more on using the detections as a priori information to track objects moving through camera frames. This was mostly tested on camera feeds of people a few metres from the camera, so there may be some lag when using it for front-on webcam testing. The tracking algorithm used is the Kalman Filter for adaptive gaussian based motion prediction. 

- Will add more details later.
